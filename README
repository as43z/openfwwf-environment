This project is an environment set up for the development of custom OpenFWWF firmware.

Supported OS:
	* Debian
	* Ubuntu

TODOs!
	- Make installer a bit more general to support other OSs. (If this goes somewhere)
	- Make the repo downloader clone the repo into the HOME directory! (Quite upsetting that the clone happens into the same directory)
